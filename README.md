# Jet Polish â€” Aircraft Detailing (Next.js Starter)

This is a starter Next.js single-page site scaffold built for an aircraft detailing business. It includes SEO-friendly meta tags, Tailwind CSS, a responsive navbar with a collapsible hamburger menu, hero banner, services, about, and a contact lead capture form (API route).

Quick start (macOS / zsh):

```bash
cd jet_polish_aircraft_detailing
npm install
npm run dev
```

Deploy to Vercel: connect this repository and deploy. Next.js + API routes are supported out of the box.

Notes and next steps:
- Replace placeholder images in `/public` (hero-placeholder.jpg, favicon.ico).
- Hook `/pages/api/contact.js` to an email provider (SendGrid/Mailgun) or CRM for real lead capture.
- Add analytics and structured data for improved SEO.
